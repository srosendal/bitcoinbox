CAD files, Electronics and Code is shared here. I used a few examples online and the code is still a bit rough ie. prototype. But even though it can easily be optimized - which I probably wont do, I still wanted to share the game and concept.

More details about the game can be found [here]('https://srosendal.github.io/inventor/bitcoinbox/')
